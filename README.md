# The Lexstar 7000
(is no more)

On December 17, 2020, the NOAA apparently transitioned away from a system by which they send the national weather map as one big ol' oversized animated GIF. This, quite frankly, is understandable. It did seem more than a bit ridiculous that they kept serving it up that way for so long.

Unfortunately, however, the Lexstar 7000 depended on that giant GIF to display its map. Without that, the whole thing just boils down to something like a METAR parser, and there's better services out there that'll do that, I figure.

So, sadly, the Lexstar 7000 is now a dead project. We salute you, silly personal project I came up with while teaching myself JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

*(please ignore the fact that I didn't even notice it broke until nearly two years after the fact)*
